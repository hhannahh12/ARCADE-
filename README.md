# ARCADE
As a young woman going to festivals and events, I found it hard to find clothes that matches the current trends. Chains, two piece bralets and skirts, and all over confident clothes are not widely available. Many people turn to Depop where clothes are hand made to order to get the look they want, so i began to teach myself how to code in html and css and i bought a UDEMY course where i will advance on to learning PHP, wordpress and bootstrap. This is a really interesting course, and this is my work towards the website so far...

Now colaborating with @akshay6126 to work together using our different skills to be able to create a better website.
